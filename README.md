# movie.booking
This is a trial and my first project. Made a movie booking webpage using html,css,php,js.
It asks the user to select seats from a layout of a theater. And then in another php page, it gives the seat number of the selected seats.
Used basic HTML and internal CSS.

keep loading.php and loading.gif in xampp/htdocs folder.
Paid minimal attention to code reusability and stuff.
Hope this helps you in your minor endeavors.
